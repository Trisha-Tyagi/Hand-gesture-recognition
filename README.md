# Hand Gesture Recognition with Text-to-Speech

This project detects hand gestures in real-time using a webcam, recognizes the corresponding letters using a trained RandomForest model, and converts them to speech using `pyttsx3`. 
## Features
- Real-time hand gesture recognition using Mediapipe.
- Speaks recognized letters aloud using text-to-speech.
- Displays bounding boxes and predicted letters on the webcam feed.
- Confidence filtering to avoid mispronouncing uncertain gestures.
